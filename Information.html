      <h2>About me & the study</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Christian Davis, And a little while ago, I had a <b>pneumothorax (lung collapse), possibly from vaping weed</b>, and it completely changed how I think about what I put in my body. It made me start questioning not just vaping, but also my <b>ADHD medication</b> specifically, whether the side effects were worth it.
<br><br>
I’ve been on <b>Methylphenidate (Ritalin) 72mg</b>, and while it helps me focus, it’s also <b>chronically increased my blood pressure</b> to the point where I was almost put on <b>blood pressure meds at 15</b>. That didn’t seem normal to me, so I started looking into it more.
<br><br>
Turns out, I’m probably not the only one dealing with this. The <b>CDC reports that over 10% of kids and teens (ages 5-17) were diagnosed with ADHD between 2020-2022</b>, meaning there are millions of people my age who might be on stimulant meds and <b>experiencing similar side effects without realizing it</b>.
<br><br>
So, I decided to experiment with something different. I’m tracking my experience as I switch from stimulants to a combination of <b>microdosed mushrooms (0.25g) and THC (10mg)</b> to see if it works better for me. This isn’t about proving anything—just <b>documenting my own experience</b> and seeing if there’s a way to manage ADHD that doesn’t come with the same risks. If it helps someone else think more about their options, even better.

      <h2>Specifics of the Study</h2>
      <p>
        For the first <b>30 days</b>, I’ll be lowering my <b>Ritalin dose to 36mg</b> (the average dose) while continuing to track its effects. This will serve as a final record of my experience after <b>two years of using the medication</b>.
<br><br>
After that, I’ll switch to the <b>capsules (0.25g mushrooms + 10mg THC)</b> and track their effects on my health and ADHD symptoms for the next <b>two years</b> the remainder of my time in high school.
